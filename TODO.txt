TODO: Insert VK_CHECK where appropriate. 

TODO: Rework Queue's and Queue Families & Command buffers.
I haven't event finished writing the code & it already needs a rewrite.

TODO: Unit tests

TODO: FIFO Struct to place events into
TODO: Setup event overwritting or adding based on behavior of event. When event is fired,
it would be able to overwrite the event waiting in the event queue or
it would be able to combine its parameters in a predefined way(func pointer??)
TODO: Events: Data struct to support insertions with ordering(priority) value

TODO: Setup Debug & Release configurations

TODO: Dynamic vs static library. ??
TODO: If static: Instead of passing function pointers, just say the functions are external and get them from the sandbox file??.
TODO: If dynamic: Use volk included with the vulkan sdk to dynamically load vulkan functions.

TODO: When systems fail they should be able to call shutdown procedures if the failure is recoverable

NOTE: Sample 2D slice of 3D texture for wierd patterns.
Like mod world position with texture limits to index into tiling 3D texture.
